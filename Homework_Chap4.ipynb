    "You will work again on [pubmed_last_100k.json](https://we.tl/t-6afLCDGRsg). The goal in this homework is to insert collaboration data in Neo4j and then study it using cypher queries. The following questions are meant to guide you through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Each paper has a list of author and affiliations. The first step is to create a node per author with a list of affiliation as attribute. If a name appears multiple times consider it as a single person. Create an edge between two authors if they are on the same paper. You can use any kind of operation to clean the data before inserting, you decide which preprocessing step is the most convenient.\n",

    "2) How many authors have more than 2 affiliations ?\n",
